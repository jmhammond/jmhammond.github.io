What really irked me was how unprofessional my non-responsive images looked when I\u0026rsquo;d go in the classroom and see my site rendered on their phones.\nSo I added lightbox2 javascript library, I used Hugo\u0026rsquo;s automatic generation of smaller images (for faster load times), and changed the positioning CSS. I felt really proud because it looked great on the laptop (Safari and Firefox) and on mobile. Hooray!\nSo I shared this with my calc class today, letting them know about the changes and how I hope it\u0026rsquo;s a better user experience. I then asked, \u0026ldquo;is there anything about the site that is interfering with your learning?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes! The videos don\u0026rsquo;t allow me to load them in full screen.\u0026rdquo; 😲\n\u0026hellip; but it worked on my iPad in the classroom, and it worked on my laptop. But other students said the same thing. Everyone was using a chromium-based browser, so I said I\u0026rsquo;d install Chrome and test it out.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t replicate it. It worked fine with extensions, no extensions, private window, etc\u0026hellip; Finally, it clicked.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been accessing the page via jmhammond.github.io, whereas my students are accessing it via an iframe on our LMS, Blackboard. So I head over to blackboard and see it:\nThe a-ha moment is that if an iframe is inside another iframe, the outer frame must have the allowfullscreen property enabled for full screen to work. So I fixed it and now they can do full screen:\nThe lesson: ask your students if there\u0026rsquo;s any technological sticking points that interfere with their learning. You might be surprised what you missed!\nBut I wasn\u0026rsquo;t done there. Since the students are accessing Blackboard on their phones, I realized that I\u0026rsquo;d never done that. I\u0026rsquo;ve only tested my content outside blackboard. So I installed the Blackboard Learn app, log in, open my course, and find this:\nWhat you see there is a page that is wildly unoptimized for mobile. It is awful, and students have to scroll left/right just to read anything on that page. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been recycling this same iframe code over the last three semesters. No one told me it looked like garbage!\nThe offending code used fixed dimensions that I hacked together because Blackboard is terrible, and this allowed it to look good on my laptop:\n\u0026lt;iframe width=\u0026#34;1024\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;1200\u0026#34; ... \u0026gt; I just needed to change the width to 100% and earlier I\u0026rsquo;d added allowfullscreen, and now I\u0026rsquo;ve solved both problems. Blackboard is appropriately responsive:\nand everything renders nicely!\nAnd a bonus was that in exploring this, I found the default Hugo youtube shortcode had additional calls to Youtube to fetch information about the video that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need, so I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own shortcode that loads everything using the www.youtube-nocookie.com url for privacy and appends the ?rel=0 parameter that seems to (miraculously!?) be working again.\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy with how everything is working and behaving. Removing extra calls means the quickly loading pages is even faster. This is a win for everyone!\n","permalink":"https://jmhammond.github.io/blog/allowfullscreen-a-lesson/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last week trying to improve my site\u0026rsquo;s presentation of material for my calculus students.

This post explores how I\u0026rsquo;m not grading in my history of mathematics courses.\n\u0026ldquo;Not grading???\u0026rdquo; Yes. In my syllabus I include the line:\nI will not be grading your work\nand I follow up with:\nInstead, I\u0026rsquo;ll be giving you the freedom to explore and do your best work. I\u0026rsquo;ll be giving you feedback without the rating/judgment\nWe will be working collectively as a class to explore, learn, and discover the beauty within the development of our field of mathematics. You’ll read the readings, do suggested activities, write papers, etc, then at the halfway mark and at the end of the semester, you’ll write a brief achievement essay in which you determine, based on your own judgment, what your letter grade should be and why.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t everyone get an A?\u0026rdquo; Surprisingly no. But also, who cares if they do?\nWhy I do this in history of mathematics First, I\u0026rsquo;ve taught these courses a lot! In fact it has been 20% of all the classes I\u0026rsquo;ve taught over the last decade.\nThe class is somewhat of a \u0026ldquo;capstone\u0026rdquo; for an appreciation of mathematics. It\u0026rsquo;s not what anyone thinks of as a math class \u0026ndash; my wife calls it my \u0026ldquo;liberal arts\u0026rdquo; course. I used to call it the \u0026ldquo;hardest easy A\u0026rdquo; class because I have very high expectations for students that I believe everyone can achieve.\nAnd because I believe that, I decided about 3 semesters ago to let the students do their best work.\nWhat kind of assingments? Okay, first off, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;math\u0026rdquo; class. Yes, we solve problems. Yes, there are proofs. But we also read. A lot. Over the course of the semester read our assigned text1 cover-to-cover; many articles (as PDFs on Blackboard). We have:\nDaily reading responses and reading discussion Daily written exercises exploring the mathematics about which they read. Students write biographies of (at least) two mathematicians Students write a \u0026ldquo;biography of a topic\u0026rdquo; They give several presentations on their topics (there are at a minimum 5 presentations for each student over the course of the semester) We have frequent \u0026ldquo;hands-on\u0026rdquo; activities during class exploring things as diverse as writing cuneiform numbers on modeling clay with stylus, implementing an Incan yupana computing device, trying to independently prove number theory claims by using stacking blocks,\u0026hellip;. But how do you grade this? What does a 90% presentation look like? How does a student \u0026ldquo;get 75%\u0026rdquo; of a 50 minute exploration that even Achimedes never solved in his lifetime?\nSince ungrading, I just give the students the framework that \u0026ldquo;these are my basic expectations and requirements. Do your best, creative work.\u0026rdquo;\nReally neat projects and presentations I\u0026rsquo;ve had several phenominal presentations. Here\u0026rsquo;s some samples aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;favorites\u0026rdquo; so much as just really unique that stand out when I\u0026rsquo;m typing this:\nA student created a sextant and used it to calculate his position when he was on a dark field at night in rural Kansas. (His handmade creation of cardboard and string was obviously inaccurate, but it was closer than you\u0026rsquo;d expect!) In a related topic, another student gave a history navigation but told as a voiceover while he was playing Sea of Thieves Another student dug into the history of probability as a means to get ahead in games of chance, discovered a method of card counting and gave a presentation on these topics. She also practiced the method and reported that she won money at a local casino the weekend before her presentation. \u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s so many more. I just love this class.

Try grading differently.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve likely been using a standard \u0026ldquo;A is 90, B is 80\u0026rdquo; style of grading, and you\u0026rsquo;ve almost certainly had students come to you at the end of the semester saying, \u0026ldquo;I have an 89.1%, can you round it up to an A?\u0026rdquo;\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten that question in a couple years, and it\u0026rsquo;s been wonderful. How? I don\u0026rsquo;t use the common percentage-based grading system.\nA motivating example Let\u0026rsquo;s start off with a motivating example to get you thinking about this. Consider this example, solving a linear equation:\n$$\\begin{align*} 2x + 3 \u0026amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x \u0026amp;= 2 \\\\ x \u0026amp;= 1 \\end{align*}$$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pretend that this question is worth 10 points. How many points will you give?\nGot an answer? Why is the question even worth 10 points? It\u0026rsquo;s only two lines of work. So maybe we should just make it worth 2 points\u0026hellip; buth then if they make a mistake did they fail (50%)?\nWhat are we actually trying to measure with this question?\nAre you testing to see if students can do arithmetic? If so, they failed ($7-3 \\ne 2$). Are you testing if students can find solutions to equations? If so, they failed again, since 1 isn\u0026rsquo;t the solution. Is the question just busy work because you wanted to add more questions to a timed test or give them \u0026ldquo;easy points\u0026rdquo;? I am guilty of this\u0026hellip; Motivation for unconventional assessment Alfie Kohn writes1 of grades:\nGrades tend to reduce students’ interest in the learning itself. Grades tend to reduce students’ preference for challenging tasks. Grades tend to reduce the quality of students’ thinking. Grades aren’t valid, reliable, or objective. Grades distort the curriculum. Grades waste a lot of time that could be spent on learning. Grades encourage cheating. Grades spoil teachers’ relationships with students. Grades spoil students’ relationships with each other. This rings true, even 24 years after that article was published.\nVarieties of unconventional grading that I\u0026rsquo;m doing There are many different ways to change how you grade. Keep an eye out for the upcoming book Grading For Growth by Robert Talbert and David Clark to dig into more details of the varieties.\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;m going to explain how I use \u0026ldquo;master-based testing\u0026rdquo; in my mathematics courses. (in contrast with my history of mathematics course, which will be discussed in a second post).\nBefore the semester Begin by defining the learning outcomes for the course. Everything in your course is tied to the learning outcomes. \u0026lsquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s the learning outcomes for my calculus 1 course, for example.\nIn \u0026ldquo;Shocker Yellow,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll see what the objectives as laid out by my department, and below you\u0026rsquo;ll find individual \u0026ldquo;learning targets\u0026rdquo; that connect to the material, and below each of those, how they will be presented and what is expected of the student.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the example of \u0026ldquo;DA3: I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.\u0026rdquo; The students will be presented with a question on their weekly quiz such as:\nConsider the function $f(x) = x^2 - x^3$ on the interval $[-1,4]$ find only the absolute maximum and minimum values (extreme value theorem).\nI want to make the point that those learning targets influence the content we cover in the course and the calendar / pacing.\nDuring the semester I write new questions for the learning targets that will be assessed in the week. By my own choice, I give weekly \u0026ldquo;checkpoint\u0026rdquo; quizzes in which the students are assessed on the material. Each learning target has one or more questions that must be completed correctly in order to receive credit. I give feedback to students who get something incorrect, but all solutions for a topic must be \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; for credit on the learning target. Otherwise they can do it again next time!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a specific student example from my discrete mathematics class. The question looks like this:\nThe student\u0026rsquo;s work on checkpoint number 7 looks like this: They were totally wrong, but they had good structure. The next week, here is their work: Here some of it is good, but it\u0026rsquo;s wrong in new ways. Next week, they present this solution: \u0026hellip; this is so close! And then the next week: Great job, student! You got it!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my personal weekly schedule This is a large workload, so here\u0026rsquo;s my weekly plan I have for keeping up with the workload (just for the assessments, separate from class prep, administrative duties, etc):\n\u0026ldquo;Mondays are awful.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s my motto for grading days. I commit to getting everything graded on Monday. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;m done by 1pm, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s 11pm. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; day, but it gives me freedom the rest of the week. Tuesdays are for writing questions (two weeks ahead is ideal) Wednesdays are for proofing/checking the week\u0026rsquo;s assessments. Thursday the weekly assessment goes live. Friday is \u0026ldquo;Dad day\u0026rdquo; and I commit to not doing work (outside teaching a class) so I can otherwise be with my kids. Saturday and Sunday are family day. This really means my hard day is Monday, and I make sure everyone (my students, my family, my chair) know that I\u0026rsquo;m usually not available on that day. But it means I have a very flexible schedule / freedom the rest of the week. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this on a Tuesday morning (and I have time for it!)\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s worth it Here\u0026rsquo;s some quotes from student evaluations:\nThe checkpoint and mastery system are fantastic. Less stress, encourages learning through mistakes, personalized education, and detailed feedback. I wish more math classes used this format\nI loved the grading style and weekly checkpoint style.\nMastery grading actually motivated me to learn a subject after I missed it on an assignment because I knew I that I could make it up and that made me want to fully understand the subjects and concepts taught.\n\u0026hellip; and isn\u0026rsquo;t getting students to want to learn the material the dream?\nKohn, A.

There is good in the hope for things beyond all hope; good in the exercise of some art in which one is skilled; good in meditating upon the manifold transmutation of all nature and upon the magnitude of the Earth.

We call this the tangent line.\nIn this picture, part (a), the line $t$ is tangent to the circle. In part (b), the line $t$ is tangent to the curve at point $P$ near that point because near that point, it\u0026rsquo;s touching the curve at exactly one point. Looking outside the small interval around $P$, though, $t$ does pass through the curve in another place (making it a secant line), so thinking of \u0026ldquo;tangent\u0026rdquo; means thinking in a small neighborhood of a point!\nExample Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola $y=x^2$ at the point $P(1,1)$.\nThis example is from the textbook, and it looks at computing the slopes of secant lines (thought lines that pass through two points) near point $P(1,1)$. Here\u0026rsquo;s an excellent Geogebra exploration by WSU faculty Justin Mears which illustrates how the slopes get closer and closer to a particular value (what we\u0026rsquo;ll call a limit).\nPlease click this link and and explore the activity:\nYou can grab point $Q$ and move it. Watch as the secant lines $PQ$ (red) get closer and closer to the tangent line (green), the slope $m_{PQ}$ gets closer and closer to a particular number. What is that number? https://www.geogebra.org/m/c5479ucc\nThe Velocity Problem Here we\u0026rsquo;re asking the question - how fast am I going at this particular moment?\nRemember that $\\displaystyle \\text{Velocity} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{time}}$\nExample Consider a ball thrown in the air, whose height $t$ seconds after it is thrown is given by $s(t) = 40t - 16t^2$ in feet. Compute the average velocity for the time periods beginning at $t = 2$ seconds and lasting 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 seconds.\nCan you estimate the instantaneous velocity when $t =2$?\nThe Area Problem We can compute the area of a rectangle really easily. Triangles are basically the same (just 1/2). Straight-edged shapes like stars, pentagons, etc? Easy! Just break them up into triangles and add them together.\nIt gets a little weirder when shapes are curved. How do we find the area of the bottom picture below?\n\u0026hellip; the idea is that we\u0026rsquo;ll break it up into smaller shapes (rectangles / triangles) and add those up. But to be accurate, they need to be really, really small rectangles / triangles.\nIntegral Calculus was developed to answer this question! But it\u0026rsquo;s not just because we want to find areas.\nThe Distance Problem Distance = velocity * time.\nIn this situation, we know exactly how fast something is going. For example, our car is moving at some velocity $v(t)$. If the velocity is constant (for example, you have set cruise control to 75mph on the I-35), determining how far you go after a certain time is easy.\nHow far did you travel after 1 hour? 75 miles. After 2 hours? 150 hours. After 90 minutes? 112.5 miles.\nWhat if your velocity varies (e.g. city traffic?). Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re accelerating. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re cruising, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re stopped at a stop light. How can we determine how far you traveled? We can break up the time interval into smaller intervals and compute the velocity * time for each interval and then add them up. \u0026hellip; this is actually the area problem!\nCalculus is so cool!\nHave a question?

One-sided limits Definition: We write $$ \\lim_{x\\to a^-} f(x) = L $$ and say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is equal to $L$ if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ (as close to $L$ as we want) by making the values of $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ but not equal to $a$.\nSimilarly, we define $$ \\lim_{x\\to a^+} f(x) = L $$ to be the right-hand limit.\nConnection to total limit We say that: $$ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\text{ if and only if } \\lim_{x\\to a^-} f(x) = L \\text{ and } \\lim_{x\\to a^+} f(x) = L $$\nSome visual examples Here\u0026rsquo;s a Geogebra applet that demonstrates visually different one-sided and two-sided limits compared to the total limit. Click \u0026lsquo;animate\u0026rsquo; next to each limit and watch as the $y$-values as the $x$-values get close to the desired number.\nBe sure to adjust the slider that says Example = # because that shows three different limit examples.\nhttps://www.geogebra.org/m/AKbRXpJJ\nNote that, from the Geogebra applet:\nOn example 1, the left and write limits are the same, so $\\lim_{x\\to -3} f(x) = 3$, even though the function\u0026rsquo;s value is -1 there, and On example 3, because the left and right limits aren\u0026rsquo;t the same, we say $\\lim_{x\\to 2} f(x)$ does not exist and often write DNE. Infinite Limits Example Consider $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac1{x^2}$.\nThat graph obviously looks like this: Looking at the left and right limits, we have:\n$\\lim_{x\\to 0^-} \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\infty$\nBecause both sides tend to the same value, we say that limit $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\infty$. The limit does not exist and $\\infty$ is not a number, but because the left and right limits agree on the same value, we write the special value this way.\nCompare to the next example\nExample Consider the limit $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\dfrac{1}{x - 2}$.\nThe graph is this one: This time, my one-sided limits are as follows:\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} \\frac{1}{x-2} = -\\infty$ while $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} \\frac{1}{x-2} = \\infty$.\n\u0026hellip; in this case, the limits don\u0026rsquo;t agree, so we still say that the limit doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist but we write $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{1}{x-2} = \\text{DNE}$.\nVisually exploring vertical asymptotes If you want to play with another geogebra applet, this one explores vertical asymptotes as limits.

So let\u0026rsquo;s start by writing the inequality: $$ -1 \\le \\sin x \\le 1 $$\nbut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually matter what we plug into the sine function, it\u0026rsquo;s always bounded, so let\u0026rsquo;s instead write $\\sin (1/x)$ since that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re given in the question: $$ -1 \\le \\sin \\left(\\frac1x\\right) \\le 1 $$ \u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s still true. Okay, now our question wants us to to find the limit of $x^2 \\sin(1/x)$, what can we do to that inequality above to make it look like that? Multiply by $x^2$ everywhere. Note since $x^2$ is not negative, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the inequality signs: $$ -x^2 \\le x^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac1x\\right) \\le x^2 $$\nand we wanted to find the limit, so now we apply the limit everywhere there\u0026rsquo;s an $x$: $$ \\lim_{x \\to 0} -x^2 \\le\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac1x\\right) \\le \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 $$\nand what is $\\lim_{x\\to 0} x^2$?

This one\u0026rsquo;s neat! Since $\\lim_{x\\to 2} = 4$ (we did example in the video in section 1.6 and $f(2)=4$, the limit exists and equals the value of the function. It\u0026rsquo;s continuous everywhere since we plugged the hole! Continuity on an interval Note We define\ncontinuity from the left at a if $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to a^-} f(x) = f(a)$, and continuity from the right at a if $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$ Definition A function $f$ is said to be continuous on an interval $(a, b)$ if it continous for every number in the interval in $(a,b)$.\nExample Revisiting our function from before, on what intervals is $f$ continuous?\nClick to reveal the answer. $f$ is continuous on the intervals $(-\\infty, -5)$, $(-5, 2)$, $(2, 7)$, and $(7, \\infty)$.\nWe can write that with union notation[^1]: $(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (-5, 2)\\cup(2, 7)\\cup(7, \\infty)$.\nFacts about continuity Polynomials are continuous everywhere - all $x$ values in $(\\infty, \\infty)$. A rational function is continuous on its domain Root functions, trig functions and exponentials and logarithms1 are continuous on their domains. If you still haven\u0026rsquo;t memorized the domains of trig functions, this would be a good time to take a moment to start. Especially the sine, cosine, and tangent functions.\nExample Show that the piecewise function $$ f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{align} x \u0026amp;\\text{, if } x \u0026lt; 1 \\\\ \\sqrt{x} \u0026amp;\\text{, if } x \\ge 1 \\end{align} \\right. $$ is continuous on $(\\infty, \\infty)$.\nExample Please attempt the following example before checking the answer:\nOn what intervals are the following continuous?\n$f(x) = x^3 -4x + 1$ $g(x) = \\sqrt{x} + 2$ $b(x) = \\dfrac{x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 4}$ Click to reveal the answer. $(\\infty, \\infty)$ since it\u0026rsquo;s a polynomial $[0, \\infty)$ since this is the domain of the function. $(\\infty, \\infty)$. Sneaky! Since the denominator is always greater than or equal to 4, it can never be 0. Continuity and function algebra If $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions and the number $c$ is a constant, then the following combinations of functions are also continuous:\n$f + g$ $f-g$ $fg$ $cf$ $f/g$ if $g(x) \\ne 0$. Additionally, if $f$ is continuous at $b$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to a} g(x) = b$, then $$ \\lim_{x\\to a} f(g(x)) = f\\left( \\lim_{x\\to a} g(x) \\right) = f(b) $$\n\u0026hellip; that is, if $f$ is continuous there, we can pass the limit inside the function.\nExample Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\sin\\left( \\frac\\pi4 x \\right)$\nSolution: Since $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{\\pi}{4}x = \\frac\\pi2$ and $\\sin(x)$ is continuous at $x=\\frac\\pi2$, we can pass the limit inside the continuous sine function: $$ \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\sin\\left( \\frac\\pi4 x \\right) = \\sin\\left( \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac\\pi4 x \\right) = \\sin\\left( \\frac\\pi2 \\right) = 1 $$\nExample: Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0} x^4 \\cos\\left( \\frac1x \\right)$\nFor this one, $\\frac1x$ is discontinuous at $x=0$, so we cannot move the limit inside the cosine function! We need other tools to evaluate the limit. Give it a try (hint: Squeeze Theorem).\nIntermediate Value Theorem Suppose that $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$. *somewhere between $a$ and $b$ there\u0026rsquo;s a number for which $f(c)$ hits the desired $y$-value of $N$.\nIntuitively, if I\u0026rsquo;m Jabara Hall and want to walk to the Pod by the pond, I have to cross Perimeter2 road. My travel is continuous - I can\u0026rsquo;t teleport or use a jet pack.\nAn application example Show that the function $f(x) = x^4 + x- 3$ has a zero in the interval (1,2)\nNow practice!

We call this a position function.\nWe can define the instantaneous velocity of the object at time $t=a$ by using the formula for average velocity and applying the limit:\n$$ v(a) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$ where $h$ is an incredibly small amount of time after $t=a$ (and in the limit, goes to 0).\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine I want to drop this toy red panda off the top of Lindquist Hall. He begins its journey at 84 feet1. The equation for the position (measured in feet) of a dropped object from 84ft is $f(t) = -16t^2 + 84 $ after $a$ seconds.\nWhat is his velocity after 1 second? Note: the velocity is negative which means it\u0026rsquo;s in a down direction! How fast is he traveling when he hits the ground? Red Panda aside No red pandas (or toys) were harmed in this example. If you want to see an adorable red panda, though, check out Sedgwick County Zoo\u0026rsquo;s own Ravi 2:\nThe Derivative Because the the limit that appears in the instantaneous velocity and tangent line questions shows up so frequently, we give it a name. The Derivative\nDefinition The derivative of a function $f$ at a number $a$, denoted by $f\u0026rsquo;(a)$ is $$ f\u0026rsquo;(a) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$ provided the limit exists.\nWe pronounce $f\u0026rsquo;(a)$ as \u0026ldquo;f prime of a\u0026rdquo;.\nAlternative definition: We can also write the limit in the derivative of $f$ at point $a$ as: $$ f\u0026rsquo;(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} $$\nExample Find $f\u0026rsquo;(a)$ for $f(x) = 2x^3 - x +1$ using the definition of the derivative.\nExample: Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $f(x) = 2x^3 - x + 1$ at the point $P(1, 2)$\nRates of Change Derivatives measure the slope or rate of range of a function at a particular point.\nIf the slope is large, the function is changing is fast! If the slope is small, the function is changing slowly If the slope is positive, the function is increasing If the slope is negative, the function is decreasing Example Let $V(t) = 2t^2 - 16t + 35$ be the amount of water in a tank (in liters) after $t$ minutes.\nIs the volume of water increasing or decreasing at $t=1$ minute? Is the volume of water increasing or decreasing at $t=5$ minutes? Is the volume of water in the tank changing faster at $t=1$ or $t=5$? Is the volume of ever not changing? If so, when? Please work through this example and check your answer below: Click to reveal the answer. First, $V\u0026rsquo;(t) = 4t - 16$. So:\n$V\u0026rsquo;(1) = -12$ which means the volume is decreasing (changing in a negative direction) $V\u0026rsquo;(5) = 4$ which means the volume is increasing (change is positive) The water level is changing faster at 1 second than 5 since 12 liters per second is faster than 4 liters per second. The volume doesn\u0026rsquo;t change if $V\u0026rsquo;(t) = 0$; this happens when $t=4$ seconds. Example The graph shows the influence of the temperature $T$ on the maximum sustainable swimming speed $S$ of Coho salmon.\nWhat is the meaning of the derivative $S\u0026rsquo;(T)$ What are the units of the derivative? Estimate the values of $S\u0026rsquo;(10)$ and $S\u0026rsquo;(25)$ Example A roast turkey is taken from an oven when its temperature has reached 185°F and is placed on a table in a room where the temperature is 75°F.

The Extreme Value Theorem If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ attains an absolute maximum value $f(c)$ and an absolute minimum value $f(d)$ at some numbers $c$ and $d$ in the interval $[a, b]$.\nSimply put, on a closed interval, we\u0026rsquo;re guaranteed that a continuous function will attain an absolute maximum and minimum value. Because it can\u0026rsquo;t blow up to infinity, it must reach a high and a low point.\nFermat\u0026rsquo;s Theorem If $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at $x=c$, then $c$ is a critical number of $f$.\nExamples: Here are two very common examples:\n$f(x) = x^2$ has a minimum value at $x=0$ the bottom of the U. Since $f\u0026rsquo;(x) = 2x$ is zero when $x=0$, we see that $x=0$ is in fact a critical number of $f$.\n$g(x) = |x|$ has a minimum value at $x=0$, the bottom of the V.

We were asked to find the temperature at which water has its maximum density. Density is inversely proportional to volume: $\\text{Density} = \\dfrac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}}$ So we the maximum density will occur at the minimum volume.\n:boom: Water has the minimum density when the temperature is approximately $3.96651^\\circ$ C. :exploding_head:\nExcept Myanmar and Liberia.

It\u0026rsquo;s all related!\nNote: The Mean Value Theorem tells us that there is a number $c$ in the interval, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell us what it is. For that, we will need algebra.\nExample Determine all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusions of the Mean Value Theorem for the following function $$ f\\left( x \\right) = {x^3} + 2{x^2} - x\\hspace{0.25in}{\\rm{on}}\\hspace{0.25in}\\left[ { - 1,2} \\right] $$\nExample Suppose that we know that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on the interval $[3, 10]$, and let\u0026rsquo;s also suppose that we know that $f(3) = -2$ and the $f\u0026rsquo;(x) \\le 8$. What is the largest possible value of $f(10)$?\nAn Example You enter the I35 turnpike at 4:15pm at mile marker 57 (the 21st street entrance) You take exit 127 for Emporia at 5:00pm. No highway patrol officers caught you speeding. But was there a time when you should have been pulled over?\n{{ \u0026lt; spoiler \u0026gt; }}\nThe Mean Value Theorem says that if $f$ is a continuous function on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, then there is some $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $$ f\u0026rsquo;(c) = \\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b - a} $$ Interpreting $f(t)$ to be the distance in miles traveled down the turnpike after $t$ time hours, then we can plug in $t = 0$ for 4:15pm and $t=3/4$ for 5:00pm (since we can think of going from from 0 hours to 3/4 of an hour for our journey). Then $f(0) = 0$ (we haven\u0026rsquo;t traveled yet), and $f(3/4) = 127 - 57 = 70$\nThe MVT tells us there is some value $c$ between 0 and 3/4 hour such such: $$ f\u0026rsquo;(c) = \\dfrac{f(3/4) - f(0)}{3/4 - 0} = \\dfrac{70 - 0}{3/4 - 0} \\approx 93.33 \\text{mph} $$\nSo although your didn\u0026rsquo;t get caught (maybe, say, Waze told you about a speed trap), your average speed was over 90mph, and there was some time between 4:15 and 5:00 when you were doing it, you little lawbreaker, you! 😈\n{{ \u0026lt;/ spoiler \u0026gt; }}\nA real world example(?) Here\u0026rsquo;s a photo of a bridge in Beijing celebrating the MVT\n2\nTwo more related results Theorem If $f\u0026rsquo;(x) = 0$ for all $x$ on an interval $(a,b)$, then $f$ is constant on $(a, b)$\nTheorem If $f\u0026rsquo;(x) = g\u0026rsquo;(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval $(a,b)$, then $f - g$ is constant on $(a, b)$. That is $$ f(x) = g(x) +c \\text{ where } c \\text{ is some constant.} $$\nExample Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 42$. Notice that\n$f\u0026rsquo;(x) = 2x$ and $g\u0026rsquo;(x) = 2x$ for any $x$ on all $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Then we know the functions $f$ and $g$ must differ by a constant; that constant is $42$.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to, in my own colloquial way, call these functions \u0026ldquo;cousins\u0026rdquo;.

The result is the important part.\nBelow, we put together the limit definition of the derivative along with continuity, properties of the logarithm, and the exponential. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple-looking statement that uses all of the class Click to reveal the answer. First, recall the limit definition of the derivative: $f\u0026rsquo;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$\nLet $f(x) = \\ln x$, then $f\u0026rsquo;(x) = 1/x$, which gives the following:\n$\\begin{align*} f\u0026rsquo;(x) \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\ \\frac1x \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{\\ln(x + h) - \\ln(x)}{h} \\ \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\dfrac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{x+h}{x}\\right)}{h} \\ \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac1h \\ln\\left(\\frac{x+h}{x}\\right) \\ \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x+h}{x}\\right)^{1/h} \\ \\frac1x \u0026amp;= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{h}{x}\\right)^{1/h} \\end{align*}$ Now, letting $t = \\frac1x$, we get: $$ t = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\ln\\left(1 + ht \\right)^{1/h} $$ and replacing $\\frac{1}h = n$, then when $h \\to 0$ we have $n \\to \\infty$, which gives us $$ t = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t}{n} \\right)^{n} $$\nAlmost there. Now we write $e^t$ by replacing $t$ with what you see above:\n$\\begin{align*} e^t \u0026amp;= e^{ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t}{n} \\right)^{n}} \\ \u0026amp;= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} e^{ \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t}{n} \\right)^{n}} \\hspace{1em}\\text{ since e is continuous} \\ \u0026amp;= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{t}{n} \\right)^{n} \\hspace{1em} \\text{ inverse property} \\ \\end{align*}$\nand so, $e^t = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{t}{n} \\right)^{n}$ for all $t$. That\u0026rsquo;s pretty darned amazing.\n\u0026hellip; by the way, if that was interesting to you, consider taking a few more math classes :slight_smile:\nVIDEO HERE\nGo forth and do math! The example which shows that we can actually think of the natural exponential function as the limit $e^x = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} (1+x/n)^n$ is a mind-blowing way to end the course material.\n🎉 At this point, we have covered every piece of new material in the course :confetti_ball: . Go forth and do homework, ask questions, and such!
